			<p>An orphan, Raiden was taken in by a Stoolsmith who found him in a pile of stools. He spent most of his early childhood learning how to make stools.</p>
			 
			<p>He was best friends with Riley and PJ, the Princes of Wakahalaishmail Hold, whom he became acquainted with though their swordfighting lessons. It was something they used to entertain themselves, their clashing swords forming an unbreakable bond between them</p>
			
			<p>At 14 years old, he was recruited to be trained in the Royal Guard Academy.</p>

			<p>It was there he met Richard, the prince and emissary from Smith hold. They quickly became close friends.</p>

			<p>Raiden graduated from the Academy, the youngest ever to do so. Soon after, he was assigned to be the personal guard of Richard.

			<p>On one trip to Rosario Hold, Raiden met a fine maiden named Brianna. They easily became very close. Raiden fell for her and she likewise fell for him.</p>
			
			<p>Raiden's adoptive parent died, however, forcing him to go back home. He promised Brianna that he would return as soon as he could.</p>
			
			<p>He did. On his return he saw Richard,</p>

				<p>A wild Richard appeared!</p>
				 
				<p>Raiden used <i>Hello!</i></p>

				<p>It didn't affect the wild Richard!</p>
				 
				<p>Richard used <i>Mr. Steal Your Girl</i>!</p>
				 
				<p>It was super effective!</p>

			</div>
			 
			<p>Raiden then broke down on the floor and cried. After much weeping, he gathered his resolve and prepared his seppuku knife.</p>
			
			<p>As Raiden tried to kill himself, the ghost of his adoptive father appeared from the sky and said, <q class="in">Raiden, remember who you really are.</q></p>
			
			<p>That began Raiden's journey to reconcile himself. On his way, he met Lander, and Aguilar, who had his own problems.</p>
