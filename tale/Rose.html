			<p>The eldest of the three princesses of House Rosario, Rose was a responsible and clever girl who worked hard for what she wanted. Her one goal was to one day become a lawyer in the hopes that she can help as many people caught in the civil war as possible.</p>

			<p>She always said she had no time for petty relationships and romance. Her dream of becoming a lawyer came before all of those.</p>
			
			<p>Unfortunately, her friend Aguilar, fell in love with her.</p>
			
			<p>On the outside, they always seemed to be bickering. Most of it was just Aguilar's way of courting her, however.</p>
