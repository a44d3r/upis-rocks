			<p>Sister to Rose, and twin to Maria, Moira is the only one who actually acted like a princess. Prim and proper, she didn't swear, and was always calm and reserved. She was a bit clumsy, being especially flustered whenever Aguilar is around.</p>

			<p>After learning that Aguilar was in love with Rose and that Maria was in love with him, Moira decided that she had feelings for Aguilar and confessed.</p>
			
			<p>Aguilar stopped talking to her and started to avoid her. After two months of that, she decided to send him a letter. What could it possibly contain? Who knows...</p>
