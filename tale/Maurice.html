			<p>Aguilar's younger brother who was annoying as hell. He always begged people for food, following them until he got what he wanted. When he followed Aguilar to the Rosario Hold, he saw Maria, who to him was the most beautiful girl in the world.</p>

			<p>Unfortunately, Maria hated Maurice and loved Aguilar. When Aguilar noticed Maurice following him, he approached him and elbowed Maurice in the stomach. Hard.</p>
			
			<p>Maurice then ran to the forest planning to someday execute his doubtlessly inane and stupid revenge.</p>
