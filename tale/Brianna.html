			<p>The daughter of a tailor from Rosario Hold, Brianna had always dreamed of becoming an artist, painting everyday to achieve that goal. She had a younger sister named Riza, with whom she rarely talked.</p>

			<p>As she was painting one faithful day, she saw a young man who introduced himself as Raiden, the personal bodyguard of the Prince Smith.</p>

			<p>After some time, they became close. Brianna started to like Raiden but was confused about her true feelings. One day she finally decided that it was love.
			
			<p>Brianna told Raiden how she felt, and Raiden told her he felt the same.</p>

			<p>Raiden's father died one day however, necessitating that he go back to his home. When Raiden left Rosario Hold, Brianna met Richard, the Prince whom Raiden served. She fell in love with him truly.</p>
