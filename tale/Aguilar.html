			<p>The oldest of seven brothers, Aguilar was born in a small village outside Jones Hold.</p>

			<p>He spent most of his childhood going to the library to read books. He read and he read and he read until the library held no more new tales for him to devour. He never gave up on reading though, simply rereading the books instead of abandoning his hobby.</p>

			<p>Reading left something to be desired, however. He didn't just want to read about adventures, but also to live them. When he became old enough to be able to explore on his own, he wandered around the nearby forest, often getting home late, much to his mother's disapproval.</p>

			<p>Aguilar was a nice child, but as he became older he grew more arrogant. He became very stubborn and wouldn't listen to anyone.</p>

			<p>When he was 14, he ventured to Rosario Hold to attend the largest book fair being held there. He was eager to read as much as he can. Little did he know, however, that it was not just books that the fair held in store for him.</p>

			<p>It was there he met Rose, the princess of Rosario Hold. As he was about to take the book <i>The Stupidity of Alex Yangco</i> she also attempted at it. Aguilar, the arrogant son of a bitch he was, still took the book. He was not letting some rando take what was rightfully his.</p>

			<p>It was a rough beginning for a friendship. Rose kept following and pestering him for the book. He kept his resolve for a long time, but eventually, he got so annoyed that he just relented.</p>

			<p>Aguilar and Rose became close after that. Aguilar fell for Rose and rented a place near Rosario Hold so he could visit her more often.</p>

			<p>On one of his visits, he met Rose's twin sisters, Maria and Moira. They instantly fell for him, owing to his charm and greatness. They confessed their feelings to him, but Aguilar wasn't sure if he could reciprocate those feelings. For one, they were four years younger than him. For another, he was still in love with Rose.</p>

			<p>He still hadn't confessed to Rose. He couldn't. It was far too risky. He didn't want to jeopardise their friendship.</p>

			<p>His confusion over his feelings led him to where he felt the safest: the forest. He headed there more often than usual to moon on his thoughts.</p>

			<p>It was during one of these walks that he met two strange men named Raiden and Lander.</p>
