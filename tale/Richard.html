			<p>The son of the Tyrant Lord Smith, he was always a spoiled brat, always getting what he wanted.</p>
			
			<p>Once, he met a Royal Guardsman named Raiden, whose way of thinking he liked. As such, he decided to befriend him.
			
			<p>He saw Raiden with Brianna one time however, and he became envious of Raiden. He wanted Brianna for himself, so when Raiden went to his hometown, Richard made his move on Brianna.</p>

			<p>In one fell swoop, he successfully started a relationship and ended a friendship.</p>
