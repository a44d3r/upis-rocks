			<p>One half of the twin princes of Wakahalaishmail Hold, Riley grew up with only his brother PJ for company. Although they had conflicting personalities, they still remain very close.</p>
			 
			<p>He and his brother met their best friend, Raiden, when he was just a Royal-Guardsman-in-training. They challenged him to a clash of swords when they saw him in the Wakahalaishmail Castle.</p>

			<p>As Riley became older, he got more into politics. He kept arguing with the people around him.</p>
			
			<p>This brought him huge trouble one town fair. He got into a huge argument with random folk and got his ass whooped.</p>
			
			<p>He was left bloodied and alone until a girl, Riza, helped him. She took care of him, helping him back on his feet. They became friends soon after.</p>
			 
			<p>Riley was a weird dude. He always did strange things, such as running on all fours or going into sewers with cats. All of that, he did for one reason: to get Riza's attention.</p>
			
			<p>Riley, at one point, wanted to ask Riza to accompany him to the Jarl's Ball. He was disappointed, however, when all Riza told him was, "I'm sorry. I appreciate the effort, but no."</p>
			
			<p>They high-fived each other awkardly twice and went off in separate directions.</p>
			
			<p>Riley got over it (or so he says) and is now doing the same old shenanigans for the same reason.</p>
