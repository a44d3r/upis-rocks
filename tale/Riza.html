			<p>The younger sister of Brianna, Riza always wandered off. She was never afraid to go anywhere.</p>

			<p>She always had a human pack mule by her side called Jose. He was her best friend and they would often travel the lands of Rosario Hold together.</p>

			<p>Riza also had another set of friends from House Al-Wakahalaishmail: Riley and PJ who because of her found themselves in misfortune.</p>
	 
			<p>Riza was different from other women. She did not want to be an ordinary girl, eventually marrying and staying at home. She tried the whole love thing with the prince of House Smith, but things did not turn out well.</p>

			<p>Now she just lives her life the way she wants to because she is a strong and independent woman who donâ€™t need no man.</p>

			<p>Except for the pack mule.

			<p>She has heavy stuff.</p>
