		<q>I don't care anymore.</q>

			<p>The son of a businessman and a doctor from Jones Hold, he had a boring childhood. He was always the odd one out at home. Whenever everyone fought and cried, he was just there, laughing everything away.</p>

			<p>Lander grew up with a childhood friend named Jane, the daughter of a milkman. They would play all around the town, causing mischief and pranking people all around them.</p>

			<p>Lander and Jane grew up differently. Lander became adventurous, standing out as he did in his household. Jane, on the other hand, became more like the common townsfolk, afraid of trying new things.</p>

			<p>Lander’s father wants him to take over his business, but Lander would much rather take his own path in life.</p>

			<p>As Lander grew older, his feelings for Jane developed.

			<p>Lander ended up confessing his feelings to Jane and she was speechless, save for two words: <i>Good luck</>.</p>

			<p>Lander countinued to court Jane for many months. He gave her flowers and gifts, wrote her some <q class="in">literature</q>, and even serenaded her. Still, nothing worked.</p>

			<p>As the town ball drew near, Lander decider he would ask Jane to go with him. He planned a grand proposal, but on the day of the proposal, Lander recieved a message from Jane. It said:</p>

			<p class="letter">Dear Lander,
			<br />
			<br />
			<span class="indent">xxxxxxx</span>I Just want to thank you for the gifts you gave me. You make me happy and special. All the efforts you exerted I really appreciated it though I don’t want you expecting too much from me. I don't want the feeling of being pressured. Right at this moment the best that I can offer is the storge kind of love. Thank you, thank you for making me feel so wanted and worth it.
			<br />
			<br /> 
			All the love,<br />
			Jane</p>

			<p>When he read the letter, something inside of him broke. That same day, he left town and headed to Rosario hold to think things through. As he reached the forest though, he met two men that would change his life: Aguilar and Raiden.</p>
