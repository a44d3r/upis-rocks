			<p>One half of the Al-Wakahalaishmail twins, PJ always kept things to himself, often locking himself up in his room to listen to edgy music.</p>

			<p>He rarely went outside the castle and didn't socialize much with others.</p>
			
			<p>He was close to two people inside the hold, however: his brother Riley, and the Chief Royal Guard Felipe, who taught them how to fight with swords.</p>

			<p>It was there that PJ felt like he belonged for the first time. Tragedy struck, however, as Felipe died defending the hold from bandits.</p>
			
			<p>He let out his anger in the forest by whacking trees. There, he accidentally hit a girl, Riza, who was passing by. She was wounded.</p>

			<p>He offered to mend her wound, and as he did, they got to know each other better. PJ finally found someone else to talk to.</p>

			<p>Whenever PJ mourned the loss of Felipe, he went to Riza for comfort.</p>
			
			<p>As time passed, PJ started to develop feelings for Riza. Unfortunately, his brother Riley also had feelings for her.</p>
