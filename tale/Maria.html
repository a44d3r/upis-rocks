			<p>Sister to Rose and twin to Moira, Maria's outgoing nature gave her the label of flirty. She had an innocent face, but beneath that childish fa√ßade lay a "playful" and "woke" personality. This girl wouldn't hesitate to squeeze the living daylights out of you.</p>

			<p>One day, Rose brought Aguilar to the Rosario Castle to study. It was then that Maria first met Aguilar.
			
			<p>Their eyes met for a split second and she fell for him immediately. She knew in her heart that she would stop at nothing to win Aguilar, even though Aguilar was hopelessly in love with her sister.</p>
