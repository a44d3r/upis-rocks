			<p>The only daughter of a House Rosario milkman, Jane was very sensitive and is easily brought to tears. During times of difficulty, her childhood friend Lander kept her fairly happy and helped her cope.</p>
			
			<p>She was the type of girl you saw at the town rock concert. Throughout her whole life, she had been searching for a man to be with.</p>
			
			<p>Amusingly, she only saw Lander as a friend and nothing more.</p>
