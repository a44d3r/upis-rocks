			<p>The capital city of House Rosario was the center of all trade between the Wakahlaishmailian factions. A thriving city that many travelers used as a pit stop whenever they went to other lands.</p>
			
			<p>The Rosario faction had lively citizens who all happily served their kingdom and the royal family.</p>
			
			<p>The royal family consisted of the King and his three daughters. The Queen died of an unknown illness while on a business trip to the lands of the Smiths, though there were rumors that circulated around the kingdom that she was assassinated.</p>
