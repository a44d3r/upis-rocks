			<p>The poorest among all the factions, their capital city was full of thieves, lawyers, and businessmen... All basically the same thing. Only the bravest of adventurers would dare travel to the Jones capital city.</p>
			
			<p>The royal family consisted only of the lonely king who lived in his mountain castle. He never left due to the threat of thieves stealing the billions of treasures and mystical objects hidden within its walls.</p>
			
			<p>Some say that the King died long ago and the only thing left in that castle was a sad and lonely man...</p>
