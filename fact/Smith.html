			<p>The Smiths had the largest claim of land among the four factions. They were also the wealthiest. Their faction had been in control for 42 years and punished anyone who defied them. They manipulated the population by controlling the media, showing everyone that everything is fine, when in reality it's not.</p>
			
			<p> The royal family consisted of Lord John Smith, Queen Amidala Smith, Prince Black Smith, and Prince Richard Smith. The Queen was the only kind soul in this family.</p>
			
			<p>Little did the other members of the Royal family know that she was secretly part of an alliance seeking to overthrow the Smith empire.</p>
