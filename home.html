			<p>Strangers from another land have arrived on the shores of the the Wakahalaishmailian country, their intentions seemingly benevolent. Little did the inhabitants know, these outsiders had far more sinister goals.</p>
			
			<p> Led by the Smiths, they sought to subjugate the natives and take the land for themselves.</p>

			<p>Civil unrest stirred throughout Wakahalaishmail. The tyrannous outsiders have caused turmoil, with the native Rosarios, Joneses, and Al-Wakahalaishmails seeking to drive off the invaders.</p>
			
			<p>With the Smiths having the largest army, they were able to take most of the land, while the natives lost nearly all of what used to be their kingdom.</p>
			
			<p>How were the denizens of this land gripped by conflict affected by the new order brought about by these newcomers? Read on and find out...</p>
